99 Nights in the Forest is a survival horror game on Roblox developed by Grandma’s Favourite Games. You play as a lone survivor—or with friends—trapped in a dark, dangerous forest where the goal is to last through 99 nights. During the day, you gather wood, craft tools, and build your camp to stay alive. Once night falls, the forest becomes hostile, filled with threats like wolves, cultists, and a mysterious entity known as The Deer. Players can choose from different character classes, each with unique abilities that affect how they survive and defend their camp. Alongside simply making it through the nights, there’s a narrative element involving rescuing four missing children, which can shorten your time in the forest. The game mixes crafting and base-building with tension and atmosphere, offering both solo and cooperative play. While some players enjoy its eerie tone and progressive difficulty, others find it repetitive after completing the full 99 nights.
